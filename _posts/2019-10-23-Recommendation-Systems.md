# Recommendation Systems

Recommendation systems are essential part of every e-commerce business today. It helps the business by making sure that customers have a good experience in finding out products and finally making a purchase. There are mainly two business goals that a `recsys`(I will refer to Recommendation systems by the acronym recsys now onwards) helps improve.

### 1. Improving the `conversion` of existing customers
### 2. Improving `Retention`

Recsys have been studied and researched for a long time. As a result, there are many models/algorithms which have been invented to tackle recommendations. Recsys can be broadly divided in following categories.

### 1. Non-personalized or Content based recommendation
### 2. item-item collaborative filtering and user-user collaborative filtering(Nearest neighbor recommendor)
### 3. matrix factorization based collaborative filtering
### 4. Hybrid recommendor systems

All existing techniques of `recsys` can be mapped to one of these categories. We are going to look at each of these in separate blog posts. 

I would list down some good places where you can find more material on recsys.
